A dashboard for the Airtable Art Gallery Base.

This web application is a dashboard of a small Airtable database called Art Gallery.
Art Gallery is a built-in sample with only two tables. 
One table has a list of artists, their biographies, several photos of their 
work, and their genres. A second table groups the artists into collections of art movements.
